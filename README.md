# quadtree_and_dijkstra
This is an implementation of a quadtree and Dijkstra's algorithm (with Heap data structure). It can be compiled to a DLL. I'm using this for a game I've written in python. This C code is much faster than pure python code.

The quadtree is used for fast collision detection. Dijkstra's algorithm is used for path finding.
